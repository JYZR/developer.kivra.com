# Introduction

Welcome to the Kivra Integration Reference! Get familiar with the Kivra Integraion products and explore their features:

# The service
Kivra is a secure digital mailbox tied to your social security number or VAT-number to which you receive documents from companies, organizations and government agencies that are connected to Kivra. With Kivra you can receive, manage and archive your content wherever you are and on every platform as long as you have an internet connection.

Over one billion window envelopes are sent every year in Sweden alone, so by choosing to use Kivra you contribute to a reduced carbon footprint!

Kivra acts as a digital postman between Sender and Recipients which is also reflected in the allocation of responsibilities. Concretely, this means that the Sender is responsible for the design and content whereas Recipients are responsible for reading and processing the received content.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
